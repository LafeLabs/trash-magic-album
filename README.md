Trash Magic is self-replicating media on the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web).  This repository is a self-replicating set of files which create albums of music tracks as a web page. 

The purpose of Trash Magic is to build a society without mines, where we build everything we need from trash and what we can grow using self-relicaitng media.  To start this process, we take laptops driven into [planned obsolescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence) by the tech industry and convert them into free media machines using free software which can both create and share media directly over local networks.

We then use these physical servers rescued from the consumer waste stream and use them for direct distribution of media of all kinds inclding music, podcasts, news, science, math, technology, books, zines, and absolutely anything else that can be recorded on media.  

We call these trash magic servers because they can "serve" content to anyone on whatever network they are on.  These servers have no private property and no private users, they are just used for totally free distribution of media.  

This repository is specifically for building albums in trash magic.  On any given trash magic server, you can use the replicator link above to make a branch that is this album. Then you can drop music files into the folder "tracks" and they should all load in the browser.  

One server could in theory have hundreds of albums or more!  Each album can have a whole universe of social media linking listeners with creators and with each other and building community outside of the centralized control of the tech corporations which have seized power over the Internet.
